Exploring data about Nobel Laureates with R

This project will have several aspects:

- Querying the Rest API provided by the Nobel Prize Organisation to gather information about Nobel Laureates and the prizes that they won
- Flattening the JSON data so that it can be saved as a CSV file
- Cleaning and extending the data from the Nobel Prize Organization
- Extending the data using wikidata
- Presenting and visualizing the combined data
